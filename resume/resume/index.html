		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>With my great experience in computers I began my study of computer software technology  at Technical career institutes.  There I learned skills such as beginner C++, and Java, along with various programs inside microsoft office.  These skills have helped me better my typing speed and accuracy making my work more efficent and error free.  I have had work experience that required information to be inputed as quickly and as accurately as possible.  I look forward to putting my current skillset to use to perfect them as well as adding on new skills to my current skillset.</p>
